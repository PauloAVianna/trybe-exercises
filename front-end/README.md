# FRONT-END

In this module I learned about `HTML forms`, `CSS Flexbox` and how to use external JavaScript libraries. Next I learned how to create styles responsively, focusing on different screen sizes. And then I learned about the main features of the latest version of JavaScript, `ES6`. In the last part, I learned how to use the `React` framework to create front-end applications that connect to APIs.

This gave me the ability to create responsive form-based pages, using external frameworks and libraries for form styling and data validation. I now know how to use the main features of `ECMAScript 6`, the latest version of `JavaScript`. And I am also able to create complete front-end applications using the `React` framework.

With that in mind, this folder contains all the learning activities I developed during the `Front-end` module of [Trybe's] course (https://www.betrybe.com/).
