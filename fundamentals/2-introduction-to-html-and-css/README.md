# Section - HTML AND CSS

This block belongs to the `fundamentals' module of [Trybe's] course (https://www.betrybe.com/). In this block I learned about the main HTML tags to create the structure of web pages, I learned how to use CSS to stylize these tags using different ways to select the HTML elements, and then I saw how to change the positioning of the elements in the page and how some specific properties change the dimensions of the elements, lastly I saw about the meaning that each HTML element carries and how this impacts the interpretation of the page content by robots and other internet elements.

Here you will find the exercises that I developed to fix the knowledge I acquired throughout this block. I also developed the project at the end of the block to evaluate everything I had learned, you can access it [here] (addLinkDoProjetoFuturamente).
