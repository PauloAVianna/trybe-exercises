# DAY 3

At the end of the day I learned how to:

* Copy an existing GitHub repository to your computer;
* Open pull requests;
* Upload your local repository to GitHub;
* Upload your projects to the remote GitHub repository;
* Work on the same project, with more than one person, asynchronously and distributed.
