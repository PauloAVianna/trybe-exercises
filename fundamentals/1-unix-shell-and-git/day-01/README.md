# DAY 1

At the end of the first day I saw how Unix works and how we interact with it in the terminal using the Shell.

The main points covered were:

* What are the main components of Unix?
* What are its variations?
* What is the directory structure?
* What is the terminal?
* What are the main commands executed in the Shell?
