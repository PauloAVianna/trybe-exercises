# DAY 4

The objective of this day's exercises was to put into practice what I had learned about semantic HTML. To do this I had to use the initial code below to develop a page that presents one of the most impressive animals that exist: the [Stomatopoda](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/phenomena/2014/07/03/natures-most-amazing-eyes-just-got-a-bit-weirder/). All the styling of the page was left to my own discretion.

The requirements of the exercise are:

1. Add a header to the page with the title `Punch at 80km/h: Meet the Stomatopoda'.

2. Add a set of links that represent the navigation area of the site.
  * Create a link called `Home Page`.
  * Create a link called `About`.
  * Create a link called `Contact`.

3. Create an article that will contain the interesting facts about the `Stomatopoda'. The article will be subtitled `Facts about the Stomatopoda`.

4. Divide the article into sections, organizing it as follows:
  * A first section containing general information about the animal. The subtitle for this section is at my discretion. It must have its scientific name, which is `Odontodactylus scyllarus` in italics. In addition, there must be tabular information about its scientific classification, specifically: `Realm`, `Phylum`, `Subphylum`, `Class`, `Subclass` and `Order`.
  * The other sections concern the interesting facts you have chosen about the animal. For each fact chosen a section must be created.
  * Add to each section a subheading for the chosen fact.
  * For each section, add paragraph(s) describing the chosen fact. Highlighting striking features concerning the fact that chosen, in order to reinforce the uniqueness of the `Stomatopoda'.
  * Add, for each section, an image, as a way to illustrate the fact.
  * Add, finally, a bibliographical references section, containing a list of all the links that were used as a basis to compile the page in question.

5. Add adjacent content to the article, providing a link to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Li1k5hGBE), which shows the animal in action.

6. Add a footer to the page, showing something like "Content compiled by , ".

It is `mandatory` to use at least elements with the following tags: header, nav, article, section, h1, h2, h3, aside, footer, table, and img.
